# heic2jpg
> Simple HEIC converter script.
## Requirements
In order to work, heic2jpg requires two Python modules: Pillow and pyheif.
You can install them using the .txt file in the current repository:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to use
Put the script in a directory with some HEIC images and run this code on terminal:
```
python3 /path/to/heic2jpg.py
```
And that's it! In a couple of seconds, every HEIC in the directory will be converted into JPEGs.
